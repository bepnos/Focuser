# Focuser
Focuser is a miminlastic study tracker which also includes a stats page to track previous progress. This is a personal project that I personally to keep track of the work I performed. Anyone is free to use this however the app is still in early stages of development and might not work on all mobile devices. I myself use an android phone and Linux desktop and these are both supported but I can't guarantee other platforms.
